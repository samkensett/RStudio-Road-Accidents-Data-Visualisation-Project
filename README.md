# Road Accidents Visualisations
This Repository provides the code that can be used to answer the following research question: 

Is the decline in UK road accidents since 2012 consistent across geography, severity, and demographics?

The pdf file illustrates the visualisations that can be produced from this project and evaluates their implications.

The project contains six R files. The preprocessing file should be used first as it includes all required packages, datasets, and relevant wrangling to prepare the data for analysis. After this, the visualisation codes can be run individually. Each Fig file contains the code for one visualisation used to help answer the research question.


Instructions for running the code:

1. To download the original datasets, navigate to: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data
2. Press "show more", scroll down and download these datasets: "Road Safety Data - Casualties 1979 - Latest Published Year", "Road Safety Data - Collisions 1979 - Latest Published Year", and "Road Safety Data - Vehicles 1979 - Latest Published Year"
3. Download the R files from this repository and make sure they are part of the same project, and in the same folder as the downloaded datasets.
4. Run the code on the preprocessing file.
5. This code may take some time as the datasets are very large.
6. Once this code has been run, the code on the following files can be run to produce the corresponding visualisation.
